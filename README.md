Description:

This is my final project for the website develpment,it will have 6 different pages , each one with different content, the styles of th epages will be apllied all in one css file and also i will have a folder for storing the images i will use in all the website.

Problems: I had some problems with the CV file as i tried to put the pdf file in Visual Estudio but the information will not display after the download.
Also i hadsome problems with some css styles.

Solutions:I used tools as chat gpt and youtube for completing the things i wasn't sure about. I leaned a lot with this project.
